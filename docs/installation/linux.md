## Before You Begin

1. Make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-debian-9) v10 or higher, [Git](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/) and [MongoDB](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mongodb-on-debian-9).
2. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/Androz2091/AtlantaBot.git`.
3. Run `cd AtlantaBot` to move in the folder that Git has just created.

## Edit the configuration

You need to clone the `config.sample.js` file and to rename it to `config.js`. You will then have to complete it with your informations.

Obtain the necessary API keys:

*   [Blague.xyz](https://blague.xyz/login) API key is used for the `joke` command
*   [Amethyste](https://api.amethyste.moe/register) API key is used for some images command
*   [FortniteTracker](https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api) API key is used for the fortnite stats command

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not have some API keys, such as the Discordbots key, leave the fields empty, the commands/features that use them will be automatically disabled.
{% endhint %}

For emojis, you must add them on one of your bot's servers and enter the string of the emoji (<:emojiName:emojiID>). If you are lazy to add them, you can join [**this server**](https://discord.gg/NPkySYKMkN) on which you will only have to add your bot to access a bank of emojis!
